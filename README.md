# tictactoe
A recreation of tic-tac-toe with my own design elements. Currently only supporting a 2 player configuration. AI coming soon.

## Description

The motivation for building this simple game was to illustrate an understanding of objects, modules and factory functions. I created tic-tac-toe becuase its an interactive game that can be enjoyed. Furthermore I decided to incorporate design elements to increse the user experience. It solves several issues such as dealing with 2 players, saving their responses and recording who is currently playing. The important thing about tic-tac-toe is declaring a winner or a tie. That is done by observing what the players have selected and comparing it with the winning possibilities. 
I learned quite alot from this project, primarily the focus on modules and factory functions. My code is quite sloppy and in future projects I plan to bare in mind what I have learned from this project. One example is to avoid GLOBAL variables at all costs. They are a security risk and should be contained within modules/functions. Another thing I can work on is reducing my DOM caches. Be intentional where I queryselect HTML elements and make them reusable instead of constantly searching for the elements. It all boils down to preperation and being intentional with my code and functions before I start. I have definetly learned the importance and significance of scope working on this assignment. 

## Installation

Currently can only be played on browser with 2 individuals where 1 person controls the inputs.
